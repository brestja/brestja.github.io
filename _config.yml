            As an API Documentation Engineer, my main tasks include:

            Design and create clear and detailed documentation for APIs. This includes specifying the various endpoints, input and output parameters, error codes, and usage examples. Test and validate the APIs to ensure their stability and proper functioning. To do this I use tools like Postman and cURL to send requests and verify responses. Work closely with the API development team to understand and document its functionality and features. Keep your API documentation up to date and ensure it remains accurate and relevant as your code evolves.
            
            As a Data Pipeline Automation and Documentation Engineer, my main tasks include:
            
            Design and create detailed documentation for the pipelines, this includes specifying the data flow, the different components, processes as well as the input and output parameters.
            Use tools such as Zapier, Integromat and n8n to automate data pipelines and ensure their correct operation.
            Work closely with the data engineering team to understand their needs and develop efficient and sustainable solutions.
            Keep data pipelines current and ensure their stability and efficiency as the volume and complexity of data increase.
            Create Telegram bots to facilitate access to data and interaction with the data engineering team.
